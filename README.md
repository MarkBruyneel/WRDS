# WRDS
Test scripts to access data from the  WRDS platform (Wharton Research Data Services).

The intention is to show how easy it is to get data using a combination of Python and PostGreSQL code.

The SP500 script file shows an example of how to download a historical SP500 index list with company codes from several commercial databases hosted on WRDS servers. Using It will not only require access to the commercial platform WRDS, but also licenses to commercial databases from CRSP and Compustat.
